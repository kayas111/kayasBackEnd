Muzafaluh argued out an opinion or view with one of the moderators but before he concluded, his time had run out and the mic was to be handed over to the next speaker who also had a minute to speak and was later on called for the next chance to speak again i.e. Muzafaluh Kabuulwa was called to speak in the next oppurtunity.<p></p>By around 3:45pm it was confirmed that only Maseruka Robert had not arrived yet.<p></p>All leaders who were present had opportunity to speak out when the chances were given. <span style={{color:\"red\",fontWeight:\"bold\"}}>Nattabi margret said her greatest failure in the government was when she failed to advise her \"boss\", on how he placed an NRM member in the cabinet.</span>\r\n<p></p>Part of the crowd was heard shouting publically that Muzafaluh Kabuulwa had a connection with the act where some of the members were taken to police, <span style={{color:\"red\",fontWeight:\"bold\"}}>How true is this?</span><p></p>The debate ended at exactly 3:55pm where one moderator summarized by applauding the two candidates, Mr. Strategy and Alinaitwe for being the only candidates who reported on time.

Below is I, by names of Isaac Opio a.k.a Kayas, a student at Makerere University as well. I have stayed in hostel and I will be giving a brief about hostel on a very small note.<p></p>\r\n\r\n   \r\n   <div style={{paddingTop:\"30px\"}} class=\"row\">\r\n   <div class=\"col-6 col-md-3\"> <img src={isaac2} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /></div>\r\n   <div class=\"col-6 col-md-3\">I am Isaac Opio, a student at Makerere University and I will be offering you a hostel tour session.<p></p>Let's keep it Kayas</div>\r\n  \r\n   </div>\r\n   <p></p>The only answer that answers the question 'How much are hostels at campus?' is; hostels can cost from as low as 500,000 shillings per semester to as high as 2 million shillings per semester. A semester is usually 4 months and this means the amount you choose to pay is for 4 months staying in hostel. The fee caters for both power and electricity bills inclusive.\r\n       <p></p>Why hostels differ in prices is because they also differ in the quality and number of services they offer. Majority of us imagine a hostel room as just a basic plain room and that's all, which is very correct. How about you think of a room that has a wardrope for you to organize your clothes? How about you think of a room that has a persoanlized/private balcony outside that you could use for your cooking conviniences and any other issues? How about a room that is really extremely spacious than the ordinary room you had in mind? How about a room that has another room with a bathroom and toilet inside such that you do not have to use external wash rooms?  <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>That is why hostel prices differ!</span>\r\n       <p></p>Most hostels are doubles which means you stay two people in the room and each one pays the hostel fee individually. <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>There is no cost sharing in hostels</span>\r\n       <p></p>Some hostels offer single rooms; these are rooms that only one person stays in. Staying in a room alone definitely offers you more personal privacy and this also affects the price you would pay for it. It is definitely a little more than that paid for staying in a double room.\r\n       <p></p><div style={{color:\"red\",fontSize:\"25px\"}}>Hostel tour sessions!</div>\r\n       I do offer hostel tour sessions to those joining especially Makerere University because it is where I reside and am more reliable incase of anything. For those joining MUBS I do have to make an appointment and make a 15 minutes travel for anything.\r\n       <p></p>The purpose of the hostel tour is to walk you around various hostels in Makerere such that you have a look at various rooms and hostel looks so that you are able to make a choice according to your interests. The tour session is at a <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>cost of 20,000 shillings per student.
