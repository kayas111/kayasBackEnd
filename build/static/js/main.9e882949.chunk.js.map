Muzafaluh argued out an opinion or view with one of the moderators but before he concluded, his time had run out and the mic was to be handed over to the next speaker who also had a minute to speak and was later on called for the next chance to speak again i.e. Muzafaluh Kabuulwa was called to speak in the next oppurtunity.<p></p>By around 3:45pm it was confirmed that only Maseruka Robert had not arrived yet.<p></p>All leaders who were present had opportunity to speak out when the chances were given. <span style={{color:\"red\",fontWeight:\"bold\"}}>Nattabi margret said her greatest failure in the government was when she failed to advise her \"boss\", on how he placed an NRM member in the cabinet.</span>\r\n<p></p>Part of the crowd was heard shouting publically that Muzafaluh Kabuulwa had a connection with the act where some of the members were taken to police, <span style={{color:\"red\",fontWeight:\"bold\"}}>How true is this?</span><p></p>The debate ended at exactly 3:55pm where one moderator summarized by applauding the two candidates, Mr. Strategy and Alinaitwe for being the only candidates who reported on time.

It is among the oldest halls on campus.\r\n\r\nThe first intake into this Hall was second year students who were <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>transferred from (Northcote hall by then)</span> now Nsibirwa hall. The structure of the building was rectangular in form. During 1960/61 the original plan was alterated.\r\n<p></p>\r\n <div style={{color:\"red\"}}>HALL CULTURE</div>\r\nThe students call their hall, the only hall on campus, with a culture of special and strong meekness symbolised by their association <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>with a goat</span> - thus the language of goat land.\r\n \"Heb! Heb! Heb!\"\r\n<br></br>\r\nThe monument of a goat represents the hall and is highly respected by both the former and current students who reside in the hall.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>goats decided to look for she-goats</span>, the hunting ended up in a hostel called Garden courts which is found off Sir Apollo Kagwa road. \r\n<br></br>\r\nThey united both cultures and came up with a new name <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>\"Unicourts solidarity\"</span>.\r\n\r\nSince that day, all cultural activities are are carried out together as \"Unicourt solidarity\"\r\n<p></p>\r\n<AdoniaReporterProfile/>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div style={{color:\"orange\",background:\"black\",padding:\"5px\",textAlign:\"center\",fontSize:\"15px\"}}>Lumumba Hall</div>\r\n\r\nLumumba hall was built in 1960's and was opened in 1971.

He said he is a 3rd year student, persuing a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture at CAES, a resident of NorthCote particularly Nsibirwa Hall and is currently a Guild presidential candidate. He actually added <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>that he is actually the next Guild president if all Makerereans agree</span>. Akim said he has grown up from a humble background and said his emotions are very cool. He added that even if he is angered, he takes long to respond because he knows that he needs people in the future because it is the people who have brought him up.\r\n  <div> <img src={client28simg1} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  />\r\n  <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>Akim Katabzi being interviewed by Kayas</span>\r\n  \r\n  <p></p></div>\r\n  <SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"How is the race or what do you say about it?\"/> \r\n<span style={{color:\"red\"}}>Katabazi said the 90th Guild presidential race is very tight</span> and also tricky and every now and then, it is facing a storm and that winds are blowing because <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>before he declared himself, there were candidates who were sounding but now they faded off</span> and others are coming in, students have different perceptions and the race is changing at a rate he is not understanding.<p></p> He said that he is <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>very happy because the race is now changing to his side</span> because every moment and where ever he is passing, he is <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>getting new people getting to him, people are calling his name</span> yet it was not the case before. He added that he attributes that to his hard work and recognizes his committed team.\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What do you say about campaigns and elections being conducted online?\"/> \r\nAkim said that <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>they are lucky to have virtual elections</span> because the candidates who have good leadership skills but <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>are not financially doing well can still contest</span> because funding a rally is expensive compared to paying bloggers and he suggested that virtual elections could be better however <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>virtual elections are also troublesome.</span> He added that very many students find trouble with voting where some <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>one has to keep trying to log in several times</span> in order to access the system and added that if a voter is not patient, the person may give up. <p></p>He said the problem of such issues is a bit technical and also that it is so much confusing <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>like in the last election where most students currently in year 2 never voted and those who voted did so after the official time of voting</span>. Akim said that it was because their students numbers were being rejected by the system till when the IT department erectified the matter. He added that the students <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>had to vote with one of their student number digits dropped off</span> which creates fear whether the person actual voting with a wrong registration number is actually the person he or she claims he or she is.<p></p> Akim empahazied again that the <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>virtual campaigns and election are cheap</span> and ended that the voting system being a computer system, he thinks <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>the system can be manipulated because they are computers</span> and he does not think computers are moe intelligent than humans so it means they can be tampered with. <p></p>He added that whereas the administration and the dean is assuring them that the system is effective, the program was designed by humans so it means it can be tampered by the humans.\r\n <SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"So what are you trying to do now?\"/>\r\n Akim quoted that Alionzi lawrence, <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>the 88th Guild President once</span> quoted that \"The voice of the people is the voice of God\" and so when the power of the people is too strong, it can not be subbotagged. \r\n <SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"Why do you believe you are a strong candidate?\"/>\r\n Akim said that because he is an independent candidate meaning that he holds students aspirations and not political party aspirations. He added that there are others who are <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>gaining fame because of the berets</span> they are putting on and they think people will be inline with them and added that those are not people who are serving students' interests. He added that <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>he is receiving phone calls from his competitors (oponents)</span> and that means the opponents are feeling his intensity.<p></p> Akim said the calls he receives are always <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>questioning him how the race is and also inquiring what his plans are and also that how \"they\" should do it to serve Makerere together</span>. \r\n <SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What advice can you share to the Makerereans?\"/>\r\n Akim started by quoting that President Barack Obama in 2012 said, \"I dont believe in the change which I can  bring by myself, but rather the change which we all the united ones can bring.\" Akim hereafter said that he can not change Makerere alone but with all Makerereans united, Makerere can be changed. He advised that it is the votes that determine the destination. He added that Makerereans should not vote any leader <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>because some one is putting on a beret</span> but rather use intellectaulism to judge candidates. <p></p>He added that students should listen to all the candidates and the most competent candidate should be the one to take. He also added that students should not vote people they have not seen because students will end up misplacing thier votes. <p></p>He added that students should not be influenced and ideally added that let political parties not influence students. He said <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>political parties are not helping at all in these matters</span>. He said the political parties have <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>their own ambitions and that when a political party fronts a candidate, that candidate is serving political party ambitions</span> and not students' ambitions then he said that it is better to go to Akim Katabazi who is an independent candidate and said that he is a candidate who has sponsored himself through the campaigns. <p></p>Akim said those who are affiliated to political parties are funded by their parties and at the end, the part expects the money back. Akim ended saying that him being an independent candidate, he will do the works without any influence and he urged all Makerereans not to vote candidates <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>whose pictures display them being arrested and said they are really incompetent</span>.  Akim also added that there are people who are taking photos with police in certain postures and claim they talking. He added that students need action leaders <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>and not camera leaders</span>. \r\n <SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What are you trying to do about your campaign?\"/>\r\n He said he is reaching out to people and he wants people to see and judge him if he is competent to lead the students. \r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What request do you have to the Makerereans?\"/>\r\nKatabazi said he calls upon vigilance in the election. He added that some students have lost morale in the student leadership but he asks them to give it a last try by testing the person who is to lead and he said it was him. He also asked students <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>to give him a chance, a try</span> and if he does not archieve 40 percent of what he is projecting for students in the first 4 months, <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>he will be the first guild president in Makerere to resign from office</span> because it means he will have failed.\r\n</div>)\r\n  } \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  return(\r\n    <div>\r\n        <MukNav/>\r\n      <Client id=\"client28s\"\r\n      seeMore=\"/pages/campus\"\r\n       opinionsHeading1=\"reactions have been posted in response to Given's question below his photo.\"\r\n       code={Code()}\r\n        opinionsHeading2=\"reactions have been posted in reaction to his question above.

Here below is how it started:\r\n \r\n <SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"Who are you?\"/>\r\nHamis said he is a person who is competent, always fulfills his promises, he is confident and loves his country and institution so much and loves his culture as a person.  <p></p>\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"How is the race or what do you say about it?\"/>\r\nHe said <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>he is becoming vibrant because of the steps he took</span> and that students have hopes in him and very soon he will be among the top candidates who are leading the race in Makerere\r\n <div> <img src={client33simg1} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n  <div style={{color:\"red\"}}>Kabaale Hamis welcomes Kayas</div>\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What do you say about elections and campaigns being online?\"/>\r\nHamis said he does not second the online elections and added that the 90th electoral commission observed what was in the system but no one knew who is in control of the system and added that he as an aspirant <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>has a feeling that if he is not in favour of the administration even though when students decide to vote for him, he is not sure whether they can allow for transparency.</span> Hamis would prefer a physical election such that votes can be counted from polling stations and every one will be contented with the results. He added that Makerere having more than 30,000 students, campaigning online is very hard and said that it is very hard to get contacts of all Makerereans and start inboxing every contact yet the students do not know a candidate physically and that convincing a student online is a very difficult thing. <p></p>\r\nHamis said that <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>allowing candidates to move with about 15 people</span> was a little worthy but said that even if one moves with 15 people, the team is still small and makes it still hard to reach out to every student trying to talk to them and before concluding said that was a very big challenge. \r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What are you trying to do about your campaign?\"/>\r\nHamis said he is trying to advertise or publicize himslef in a unique way such that he can get students' attention and is <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>soon organizing \"kakomando Day\"</span>. He said it is not an event that is against the social event regulations of the University but rather because most of the students around <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>univeristy are from poor backgrounds.</span>  He said on \"kakomando day\", he wants every student to enjoy the meal and that  <span style={{color:\"red\"}}> when you look at the life of government students, they are really struggling being in the university. </span> He added that the day is for <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>hustlers because most students are hustlers</span>.\r\n <div> <img src={client33simg3} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n  <div style={{color:\"red\"}}>Kayas interviewing Hamis</div>\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"Why do you believe you are a strong candidate?\"/>\r\nHe said he has an impressive manifesto and according to the ideas in his manifesto, there is no candidate who has the ideas because the manifesto looks at advocating for increased entrants for both private and government sponsored students, government allowance increament, students welfare, strengthening the formerly established students associations in Makerere, reintroduction of intellectual debates among others.\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What advice do you share to the makerereans?\"/>\r\nHamis said that the way the administration is driving them <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>is weakening their brains mentally</span> because of the time taken in classes studying and concentrating on theory compared to practicals. He said that  one can spend <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>4 years in Makerere only studying theory.</span><p></p>\r\nHe said Makerereans have developed a thinking that getting better grades is upgrading the nation and said that when standards are compared right now, makerere university is not performing compared to how it did in the recent years and advised students to bring back the glory of Makerere university through the solidarity and standing on the culture which was in Makerere in the recent years. He said the bonds built alot.<p></p>\r\nHe said without a common agenda, students can end up fighting each other and that <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>a president can finish his or her term without any archievement in the term of office because the leader in his/her position looks for a way to remain in power and looks for all means to stay in power instead of concentrating on serving people. </span>\r\n<div> <img src={client33simg2} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n<p></p>He concluded saying that after the race, he expects <span style={{color:\"red\"}}> all aspirants to think together and push for a common goal because they all face the same challenges. </span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What request do you have to the Makererans?\"/>\r\nHamis requested for  a vote and support, for Makerereans <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>to stand together with him and front him to win the race.</span>\r\n\r\n<div> <img src={client33simg4} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n<div style={{color:\"red\"}}>Kabaale Hamis- Aspiraing 90th Guild president, Makerere University.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>)\r\n  } \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  return(\r\n    <div>\r\n        <MukNav/>\r\n      <Client id=\"client33s\"\r\n      seeMore=\"/pages/campus\"\r\n       opinionsHeading1=\"reactions have been posted in response to Given's question below his photo.\"\r\n       code={Code()}\r\n        opinionsHeading2=\"reactions have been posted in reaction to his question above.

He added that he is a passionate advocate of change, one who believes that beyond Makerere, <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>there is a problem in this country</span> and that what is inside Makerere is just an effect of what is happening outside Makerere. <p></p>\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"How is the race or what do you say about it?\"/>\r\nSimon said the race is a very competitve one that has many aspirants and that every aspirant is doing their best though the mode of operation and looking for votes has changed and is challenging <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>because they do not have the best of audience.</span> \r\n <div> <img src={client36simg1} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n  <div style={{color:\"red\"}}>Wanduka Simon welcomes Kayas</div>\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What do you say about elections and campaigns being online?\"/>\r\nHe said he actually does not believe that Makerere has actually reached the level of embracing the online mode of  elections because he says it can not be accounted for because that the <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>electoral commission is actually not in control of the election system</span> but rather it is just over seeing the system, he added that even when elections are soon it is still a <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>crime to move with over 15 people and yet one is to campaign to a population of over 40,000 students</span> and he finds it very abnormal. Simon said the online campaign is not effective because a generation will be ended upto where leaders who are voted for are not the most competent but just because their fliers are the most shared in <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>the whatsapp groups and said that is very problematic</span>.<p></p>\r\nHe again totally disagreed with the online campaign, the online elections and said that students should be left to come and line up and vote for their leaders because its a voluntary process. He said that in the previous elections, <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>the administration failed to respond to the demands of the system and added that in the previous election, the 1st year students were not able to vote</span> in time where their voting started at 5pm and asked how one hour was enough for a <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>full year of students to vote</span>. He said even at this point when you have any querry in the electoral process, there is no evidence for back up because votes can not be accounted for basing on their origin yet in the traditional voting system, one could actually know how many votes were received in a given college and that at this point, a candidate has to <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>not only work hard but also pray to God for what may result</span>.<p></p>Simon said he had a chance to interract with many commissioners from the previous electoral commission and that they told him all they would do <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>was to sit and watch the monitors to see how votes kept coming in but they could also not know where votes came from.</span> Simon added that the campaign in its manner is so demanding and that the elction also can not be accounted for completely and that the most aggressive one who moves out to the students and makes students vote from their hostels turns out to become the winner.<p></p> \r\nSimon says that he is actually worried about the direction that Makerere is taking and the rate at which students are loosing grip of their own system that ushers in leaders.\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What are you trying to do about your campaign?\"/>\r\nHe said that since they have been reduced to phones, making videos and talking through fliers and stickers, the point is only to reach out to people, talking to them one on one to make them understand his agenda because he belives the best he can give to the makerereans at this time is a chance for them to interract with him at personal level and get to undertstand what he stands for as guild president and <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>not flood inboxes of students and galleries with photos and stickers</span> but he rather wants to have a one on one interrction with students so that they can appreciate what he stands for. Simon added that he is trying to reach out to students but because the trend that has been set is <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>the online approach which he called an ugly one,</span> is not one that is satisfying to him as the mode of campaign that would produce the best of quality that Makerere deserves.\r\n <div> <img src={client36simg3} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n  <div style={{color:\"red\"}}>Simon having a talk with Kayas</div>\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"Why do you believe you are a strong candidate?\"/>\r\nWanduka said he believes he is a representation of Makerere in the current times and that the current Makerere is the one that he understands and also what the current times demand for. He added that because he thinks he is the right candidate that understands what the students' community needs, because of his experience in the political space and because he can easily identify solutions for the problems <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>other than lamenting like many of the rest of the candidates would do and also that he has a solution to the problems, he has a manifesto that actually responds to the challenges of students and that he knows there is need to re-orient the students' community about the leadership. He said he has the capacity to build back the solidarity of the students and that's why he belives he is the strongest candidate.</span><p></p>\r\nHe added that he is running his campaign in the undergraduate uniform (the red gown) and he belives it is more of re-orienting the general public about their position as students in the university because he says students buy the gowns when they are joining makerere but <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>that when those gowns are put on by about 10 students</span> and are trying to go and attend classes, a police patrol will have intercepted the students asking questions where the students are heading to yet it is the gown that is bought as one joins Makerere. He said he is actually showing students that the gown that one buys, one does not owe any one an <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>explanation on what time one has to put on the gown. He added that a student has the right to put on the gown when they are happy or when they are sad or when they wish to go to class with it.</span><p></p> He said there is need to make students own their leadership and also hold their leaders accountable, that there is need for students to push their leaders to the direction they as students want to be and that if students are dissatisfied of how their leaders operate, their is need for students to wake up and tell their leaders that that would not be the kind of leader they chose.\r\nSimon says he <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>feels that pain of students who have balances of only 50,000shs failing to sit for exams, the pain of a student pending graduation because of only one paper and has to wait for a full academic year to redo one paper, the pain of a student losing out on all their social life for expample failure to hold porridge nights, cultural gallas yet those are events that have never killed any one.</span>  \r\n<div> <img src={client36simg2} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"Kayas loves you\"  /></div>\r\n<div style={{color:\"red\"}}>Wanduka Simon- Aspiring 90th Guild President, Makerere university</div>\r\n\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What advice do you share to the makerereans?\"/>\r\nSimon said that at this point in time, they have one choice to make. He added that there is an African saying that goes, <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>\"when a foolish man touches his pocket and finds a hole in it, he thinks he is very poor, but when a wise man touches his pocket and finds a hole in it, he finds it as an opportunity to scratch his testicles\"</span>. He said its just one of the rare opportunities Makerereans have to redefine the students' politics, to redifine the students' power, to redifine their position in Makerere as stake holders and that students and the leaders are at a point where they have to request and negotiate for what belongs to them, a point of knees, begging and that not at a point of asking as it should be. He said that the 90th guild election sets a very big precedence in regards to the students' leadership in Makerere. <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>Simon said that he is not just coming to over turn events around but to set a foundation that can actually take back events to what belongs to them.</span> He added that he may not be able to change everything that has gone wrong but if he provides able leadership of the 90th guild, then the 91st and 92nd and that by 93rd, Makerereans will have regained 90% of what they have lost.<p></p>\r\n\r\n<span style={{color:\"red\"}}>He added that it is sad that students admire how the politics in Kyambogo and Mubs universities is conducted  yet they actually used to come to Makerere to understand how things are done.</span>\r\n<SubHeading2 SubHeading=\"What request do you have to the Makererans?\"/>\r\nSimon requested Makerereans to embrace his candidature and that he is one who is actually coming with a simple agenda which is to redifine their power and said that every thing else can wait but the 90th guild race can not wait. He ended by beseeching all Makerereans to vote for him and that together, they will build back what they have lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>)\r\n  } \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  return(\r\n    <div>\r\n        <MukNav/>\r\n      <Client id=\"client36s\"\r\n      seeMore=\"/pages/campus\"\r\n       opinionsHeading1=\"reactions have been posted in response to Given's question below his photo.\"\r\n       code={Code()}\r\n        opinionsHeading2=\"reactions have been posted in reaction to his question above.

Ssemanda added that those who did it may be wanted to demoralize him  but it actually made him come out bravely and he added that he is ready to share the ideas he is having to the students.

This failure arose out of their inability to hold meetings which the UNSA constitution provides that the executive shall meet <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>at least four (4) times in a year</span> and school council at least two in a year and so do the district executive and district students'council.\r\nThis rendered them vulnerable to implementing their functions and duties as enshrined in Article 6 clause 4.2 (a-f) in the UNSA constitution of 1988 as amended.\"\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div style={{color:\"red\",fontSize:\"18px\"}}>More for you below these photos:</div>\r\nIn these photos, handing over of certificates was being conducted\r\n<img src={client208simg3} class=\" d-block w-100\" alt=\"Loading an image here....\"  />\r\n<div>Handing over of certificates to the retired executives</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<img src={client208simg4} class=\" d-block w-100\" alt=\"Loading an image here....\"  />\r\n<p></p><p></p>\r\n\r\n<div style={{color:\"red\",fontSize:\"18px\"}}>Expired members still running in accounts?</div>\r\nHere is Orech's statement:<p></p>\r\n\"The district students' council meeting also noted <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>that account signatories are still members who expired two years ago. This is due to the deliberate plan hatched by the district coordinator to ensure account signatories were changed to remain with the people who wouldn't account for anything</span> and this affected the operations of the recent DEC, since they were bared from access to finances. This was in a serious breach of Article 10 clause 1.4 (f) of the UNSA constitution of 1988 as amended.\r\n<span style={{color:\"red\"}}>The funds used to facilitate the district students' council meeting was sent on the mobile money of the coordinator as it was unequivocally said by her</span>. <p></p>This contravenes grossly Article 10 clause 1.4 (a, b) of the UNSA constitution of 1988 as amended.\r\n The UNSA structures at both school and district levels in upcountry Schools are <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>seen as formations aimed at realizing the delegates for national UNSA elections and students council but not to implement the functions and duties of UNSA at those levels.\r\n</span><p></p> <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>The headteachers</span> are not deliberately remitting 20% funding from UNSA collection that remains to ensure operationalization of school executive and school councils.\r\n<p></p>At the district level, <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>the coordinators are equally corrupting the students' leadership by not giving them access to account, which keeps them very green about the 40% remittance to the district</span>.\r\nIn regards to above, UNSA is mandated to be a students' vanguard but has been deliberately disempowered to surpress students' aspirations, advocacy for their welfare and quality education.\"\r\n<p></p><p></p>\r\n<div style={{color:\"red\",fontSize:\"18px\"}}>Orech concluded with these as his recommendations.

You get a suspension from receiving a loan when you default/delay paying back.

Below is I, by names of Isaac Opio a.k.a Kayas, a student at Makerere University as well. I have stayed in hostel and I will be giving a brief about hostel on a very small note.<p></p>\r\n\r\n   \r\n   <div style={{paddingTop:\"30px\"}} class=\"row\">\r\n   <div class=\"col-6 col-md-3\"> <img src={isaac2} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /></div>\r\n   <div class=\"col-6 col-md-3\">I am Isaac Opio, a student at Makerere University and I will be offering you a hostel tour session.<p></p>Let's keep it Kayas</div>\r\n  \r\n   </div>\r\n   <p></p>The only answer that answers the question 'How much are hostels at campus?' is; hostels can cost from as low as 500,000 shillings per semester to as high as 2 million shillings per semester. A semester is usually 4 months and this means the amount you choose to pay is for 4 months staying in hostel. The fee caters for both power and electricity bills inclusive.\r\n       <p></p>Why hostels differ in prices is because they also differ in the quality and number of services they offer. Majority of us imagine a hostel room as just a basic plain room and that's all, which is very correct. How about you think of a room that has a wardrope for you to organize your clothes? How about you think of a room that has a persoanlized/private balcony outside that you could use for your cooking conviniences and any other issues? How about a room that is really extremely spacious than the ordinary room you had in mind? How about a room that has another room with a bathroom and toilet inside such that you do not have to use external wash rooms?  <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>That is why hostel prices differ!</span>\r\n       <p></p>Most hostels are doubles which means you stay two people in the room and each one pays the hostel fee individually. <span style={{color:\"red\"}}>There is no cost sharing in hostels</span>\r\n       <p></p>Some hostels offer single rooms; these are rooms that only one person stays in. Staying in a room alone definitely offers you more personal privacy and this also affects the price you would pay for it. It is definitely a little more than that paid for staying in a double room.\r\n       <p></p><div style={{color:\"red\",fontSize:\"25px\"}}>Hostel tour sessions!</div>\r\n       I do offer hostel tour sessions to those joining especially Makerere University because it is where I reside and am more reliable incase of anything. For those joining MUBS I do have to make an appointment and make a 15 minutes travel for anything.\r\n       <p></p>The purpose of the hostel tour is to walk you around various hostels in Makerere such that you have a look at various rooms and hostel looks so that you are able to make a choice according to your interests.

have gone through, my passion is directed towards serving the young generation through developing and implementing solutions to life challenges. <p></p>\r\n Life is not what we think it is at a younger age and some humans are not whom we think they are. Having gone through all the psychological tests of life and relating it to what many other young men and women go through, I involve myself in stress relieving and socializing moments, business oriented thinking, distinguishing between leadership & service versus politics and lastly realising personal strengths and weaknesses.<p></p>\r\n Part of my pride is sharing with you the team of colleagues who stood by my side, encouraged me, shared happy moments with me and above all kept intouch with me for over years.

He has alot of manly qualities and one that I’ve noticed over the years is his huge ego that makes him want most of the things or if not everything be done his way. \r\nHe is very good at explaining in detail.

Few people know the true meaning of the nickname 'Kayas' which has become well-known and a household brand. <p></p>I really appreciate and acknowledge all of your efforts on my behalf when we first met nine years ago. If you know him, you'll understand why I refer to him as an 'all-the rounder' — it's most accurate description.

He easily adapts to all kinds of moments be it sorrowful, hard times or happy times. You may never get to know the best of him if really you don't need to. He is is welcoming to everyone who comes across his gorgious eyes.<p></p>\r\n \r\n Alfred (Ovon) is one who drives his life to the best of his thoughts. He is very apologetic and has no shame in saying that he is very sorry. He is very entertaining and amongst us, he is the one with the most entertaining laughter. His laughter will not only make you laugh but will make you feel like forwarding his contact to a friend you feel needs to laugh as well. <p></p>\r\n \r\n Jean (Bhazi) is one person who takes more care about himself. He is welcoming to every one, entertaining in all situations. He loves to archieve the best in what ever he does and always works hard to archieve dreams that make him happy.\r\n \r\n <p></p>Davis (Wobu) is a very entertainig one as well and can be funny. He has no shame in anything so long as his body deserves his comfort. He is one who avoids any risky situations just because he may not be in position to handle all of them as the saying goes; 'prevention is better than cure' and also 'cowards live longer'. He is open only to those who are open to him.\r\n <p></p>\r\n </div>\r\n \r\n <img src={isaac5} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /><p></p>\r\n \r\n <img src={wobu4} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /><p></p>\r\n <img src={wobu5} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /><p></p>\r\n <img src={wobu6} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /><p></p>\r\n <img src={wobu7} class=\"d-block w-100\" alt=\"...\"  /><p></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n </div>\r\n <div class=\"col-md-3\"></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  </div>\r\n </div>\r\n \r\n<div style={{textAlign:\"center\",paddingBottom:\"20px\"}}><a style={{color:\"green\",fontSize:\"20px\",textAlign:\"center\"}}href=\"https://twitter.com/isaacopiokayas\"><span class=\"fa fa-twitter hovereffect\"> Follow Kayas on Twitter</span></a></div>\r\n </div>\r\n);}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default Brocode","import {Itemsele,CarousItem,RegistrationForm,RecommendationForm,MessageForm} from './Home';\r\nimport {Brocode} from './Brocode'\r\nimport s1 from './imgs/s1.jpg';\r\n\r\nimport s3 from './imgs/s3.jpg';\r\nimport s4 from './imgs/s4.jpg';\r\nimport s5 from './imgs/s5.jpg';\r\nimport s6 from './imgs/s6.jpg';\r\nimport s7 from './imgs/s7.jpg';\r\nimport s8 from './imgs/s8.jpg';\r\nimport wp5 from './imgs/wp5.jpg';\r\nimport ny from './imgs/ny.jpg';\r\nimport first from './imgs/first.jpg';\r\n\r\n \r\nexport function Maintenance(){\r\n\r\n return( \r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p></p>  \r\n    <div style={{fontSize:\"27px\",color:\"grey\",textAlign:\"center\",fonyWeight:\"bold\"}}>Maintenance being done</div>\r\n    <div style={{padding:\"10px\",color:\"grey\",textAlign:\"center\",fontFamily:\"charm\",fontSize:\"18px\"}}><div style={{fontSize:\"\"}}>Our dear Kayaser, <br></br>Isaac and Charles are doing some upgrades and maintenance to the website.
